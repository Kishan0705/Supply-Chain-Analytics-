➜ About Company:

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara.

📌Problem Statement:

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue by tracking the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

🎯 Goal:

The Analytics team need to measure 'On-time delivery (OT) %', 'In-full delivery (IF) %', and 'OnTime in Full (OTIF) %' daily against the target service levels for each customer.

➡️ Important Supply Chain Metrics Used:

▪️ OT % - On-time delivery percentage  
▪️ IF % - In Full delivery percentage  
▪️ OTIF % - On time and In Full delivery percentage  
▪️ LIFR - Line Fill Rate  
▪️ VOFR - Volume Fill Rate
